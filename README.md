# Scaling SaaS Onboarding: Reducing Client Go-Live Time by 40%

A detailed case study showcasing how I led a cross-functional initiative to optimize client onboarding for a SaaS platform—reducing go-live time by 40%, improving CSAT, and enabling scalable delivery.

---

## Project Summary

This project documents the redesign of a client onboarding experience for a fast-growing SaaS product. By addressing process inefficiencies, lack of standardization, and internal alignment gaps, we delivered faster, smoother onboarding outcomes.

> Result: **40% faster go-live**, **higher client satisfaction**, and **lower CSM load**.

---

## Approach

I implemented a 3-pillar framework to drive results:

### Workflow Re-Engineering
- Conducted interviews with CSMs, clients, and implementation leads
- Mapped the existing onboarding journey to uncover delays and inefficiencies
- Rebuilt the flow into milestone-based workflows with built-in checkpoints

### Standardization & Templates
- Created kickoff templates for handoffs between Sales → Implementation
- Built industry-specific client readiness checklists
- Introduced role-based onboarding paths (technical vs. business users)

### Agile Execution + Feedback Loops
- Implemented a Kanban-based onboarding tracker (visible cross-functionally)
- Launched bi-weekly onboarding reviews to adjust in real time
- Captured feedback at Day 30 to improve iteratively
